<h1>Face Detection Using Viola-Jones</h1>
<p>This is a project that implements face detection using the Viola-Jones algorithm. The Viola-Jones algorithm is a widely used algorithm for detecting faces in images, and is the basis for many commercial face detection systems.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To run this project, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>OpenCV 2 or higher</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install OpenCV and Numpy, you can use pip, which is the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use the face detection algorithm, simply run the <code>face_detection.py</code> script. This script takes an image file as input and outputs a new image with the detected faces outlined in red.</p>
<p>To run the script, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the <code>face_detection.py</code> script is located. Then run the following command:</p>
<pre><div><code>python face_detection.py &lt;image_path&gt;
</code></div></pre>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;image_path&gt;</code> with the path to the image file you want to analyze. The output image will be saved in the same directory as the input image, with the suffix &quot;_faces&quot; added to the filename.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the Viola-Jones algorithm is not perfect and may not detect all faces in an image, especially if the lighting conditions or angle of the face are not optimal. Additionally, the algorithm may also detect false positives, such as objects that resemble faces. Therefore, it is recommended to use the algorithm in combination with other face detection techniques for increased accuracy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates how to use the Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection in Python using OpenCV and Numpy. While the algorithm has some limitations, it is a powerful and widely used technique for detecting faces in images.</p>
